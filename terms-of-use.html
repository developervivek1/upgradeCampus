                           improving the Services and the Application (including without limitation for fraud
                           prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes), to ensure your
                           compliance with these Terms, to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a
                           court, administrative agency or other governmental body, to respond to content that it
                           determines is otherwise objectionable or as set forth in these Terms. </p>
                        <p> E. IIPL reserves the right in its sole discretion to investigate and take legal action
                           against anyone who engages in any illegal or prohibited conduct or otherwise violates these

                           and/or terminating the offending User's ability to access the Application and/or use Services
                           therein. IIPL may take any other action with respect to User content or User actions that it
                           deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes it may create liability
                           for IIPL or may cause IIPL to lose (in whole or in part) the Services of its ISPs or other
                           suppliers.</p>
                        <p> F. The User hereby specifically agrees to comply with the requirements of the Information

                           addition, you agree that you will not (i) publish misrepresentations or falsities that could
                           damage IIPL or any third party; (ii) host material that is obscene, unlawful, defamatory,
